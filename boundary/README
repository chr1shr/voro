2D Boundary command-line utility
by Cody Robert Dance, Jeff Johnson and Chris H. Rycroft
=======================================================

Input file
----------
This command-line utility demonstrates the functionality of the 2D Voronoi
boundary code. The utility accepts a single argument as the name of the
input file to read. The input file must have lines of three entries, separated
by spaces, corresponding to a particle ID, and its (x,y) position:

<id> <x> <y>
<id> <x> <y>
...

To create a boundary loop, the keywords "# Start" and "# End" must be included
on separate lines. A loop of three particles would look like this:

# Start
<id> <x> <y>
<id> <x> <y>
<id> <x> <y>
# End

The utility checks for many simple errors in the input file, such as finding
two start tokens in succession, or finding a boundary loop without any
terminating end token.

The boundaries must have the correct winding direction, so that they go
clockwise around the outer edge. Holes are also allowed, and for these, they
must be specified in a counter-clockwise direction. In both cases, the interior
is on the left as the boundary is traversed. The utility does not do any checks
of boundary winding, and this may cause errors if the winding is not specified
correctly.


Computation
-----------
The command-line utility first reads in the contents of the file. It computes
the size of the domain that the particles are in, and counts the number of
particles.

To carry out the computation, the library divides the domain into a rectangular
grid of equally-sized boxes. The optimal performance is obtained for around
five to fifteen particles per box, and performance is further improved if the
boxes are close to squares. The utility estimates the number of boxes based on
the domain size and the number of particles.

It then constructs the container, and imports the particles. After this is
carried out, a routine called "setup" is run, which carries out additional
computations that are needed for the non-convex case prior to computing Voronoi
cells. It scans the boundary, and searches for particles that may need to be
excluded from certain Voronoi cell computations because they lie close to a
wall.


Output
------
The code outputs several files that are designed to be plotted with Gnuplot,
although since they are text files, it should be possible to view them in other
plotting programs. Three files are created:

<filename>.bd - a drawing of the boundary
<filename>.gnu - a file with the computed Voronoi cells
<filename>.net - a file visualizing the cell connectivity

These files can be plotted in Gnuplot using the command

plot '<filename>.gnu' t "Voronoi cells", '<filename>.bd' lw 3 t "Boundary", \
     '<filename>.net' t "Connections", '<filename>' u 2:3 w p pt 7 t "Generators" 


Examples
--------
Four example files are included. They can be run with the commands

./voro++_bdry input1
./voro++_bdry input2
./voro++_bdry input3
./voro++_bdry input4

This will generate many output files. If the Gnuplot script figs.gnuplot is
run, by typing "gnuplot figs.gnuplot", then four EPS figures will be created.
